# i4Trust stakeholder MVP stack

## Introduction

### An enabler to enter the data economy
The EU funded [i4Trust project](https://i4trust.org/) has delivered an operationnal technical architecture in order to enable the implementation of __DATA SPACES__ based on __OPEN SOURCE technologies__ . In the framework of this i4Trust project, the DIH Faubourg Numérique has been selected - and funded - to support 4 experiments involving 23 SMEs from 13 different countries:
- [CO2-Mute](https://i4trust.org/experiments/co2-mute/) : a data space for public decision makers on sustainable mobility policies
- [CADS](https://i4trust.org/experiments/cads/) : a data space for the assessment of the carbon footprint of agricultural products and tools for sound agrotechnological and management decisions
- [CAST](https://i4trust.org/experiments/co2-mute/): a data space for Carbon Capture Supply Chain Trust
- [DTaaS4Aero](https://i4trust.org/experiments/DTaaS4aero/): a data space enabling Digital Twin as a service for aeronautical communications equipment and performance-based predictive maintenance

Thanks to this involvement in the i4Trust project our DIH team ran very fast through the learning curve towards concrete implementation of __DATA SPACES__ , re-inforced by the first deliverables of the [Data Spaces Support Center](https://dssc.eu/) (DSSC).

Then, this "i4Trust stakeholder MVP stack" has been build by DIH Faubourg Numérique to assemble the technical i4Trust deliverables with the goal to ease their adoption by a wide variety of organizations, especially SMEs.


In complement to this "MVP stack", the SMEs had the opportunity to use the [ouranos-ws](https://ouranos-ws.com/en/) platform to facilitate their tasks in order to leverage their active participation in DATA SPACES, following iterative steps:
- __DESIGN__ shared and harmonized data models leveraging the [Smart Data Models](https://smartdatamodels.org/) repository
- __NAVIGATE__ in the graphs of NGSI-LD entities representing their digitalized assets and those shared by other stakeholders, leveraging [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) components
- __CONTROL__ the access to their digitalized asset through the management of granular Access Policies, based on the [iShare](https://ishare.eu/) principles and services 

In [this video](https://youtu.be/YWpwInq5EOg), you can have an overview on the way the above tools were actually used by the CO2-Mute experiment, and you can also check out the [CO2-Mute immersive demo](https://youtu.be/i8GzJ-EDWhs) performed in the Smart Open MetaWorld during [IFAT Munich 2022](https://ifat.de/en/). 

We hope this will help your organization to go faster and smoother towards an active participation in Data Spaces in order to leverage the opportunities related to the Data Economy! So please, use it, fork it, ... and contribute to improve it!! Doing so, all together, maybe we can initiate and sustain an i4Trust community of practice for (E)DIHs and SMEs beyond the end of the EU funded experimental phase ... ? 

### What's in it?
The "i4Trust stakeholder MVP stack" will allow you to rapidly deploy and configure the need components to implement the "standard" i4Trust architecture:
- Orion-LD 
- Keyrock + Authorization Registry plugin + Activation Service
- Kong + i4Trus plugin 
- Wilma, as alternate PEP proxy, to "internally" access Orion-LD outside the Data Space 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 18 (with npm)

### Configuration

> The following commands works for Debian with root accessible via sudo.  
> They may differ with other operating systems.

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/faubourg-numerique/i4trust-stakeholder-mvp-stack.git
```

Access the cloned repository

```
cd i4trust-stakeholder-mvp-stack
```

Create the configuration files

```
cp ./.env.example ./.env
cp ./config/kong.yaml.example ./config/kong.yaml
cp ./config/nginx.conf.example ./config/nginx.conf
cp ./config/activation-service.yml.example ./config/activation-service.yml
```

Edit the configuration files with correct values

> It is not recommended to use different tags, the deployment could no longer work correctly.

Generate the HTTPS certificates

```
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d keyrock.example.com
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d kong.example.com
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d wilma.example.com
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d activation-service.example.com
```

> Please note that generated certificates have an expiration date. Make sure Certbot has scheduled tasks to renew them automatically.

#### Wilma configuration

> To simplify deployment, an automated Keyrock configuration script for Wilma is provided. This will create through the Keyrock API the application, pep proxy, permissions and role automatically. It must be executed only once. It is also quite possible not to use this script and to do the configuration manually.

Start the services

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Wait a few minutes for the service to be fully started.

Install the script

```
npm install --prefix ./keyrock-wilma-config-script/
```

Run the script

```
node ./keyrock-wilma-config-script/index.js
```

Update the environment file with the values provided by the script

Restart the services

```
sudo docker compose down
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Usage

Start the services

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Stop the services

```
sudo docker compose down
```

## Steps for development

For development in local, run the following steps:

 - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
 - Rename `config/kong.yaml.example` to `config/kong.yaml`
 - Remove `nginx` and `activation-service` from `docker-compose.yml` if present (That is for production)
 - Run `docker-compose up`
 - When it's started, in another terminal run:
   - `cd keyrock-wilma-config-script`
   - `npm install`
   - `cd ..`
   - `node ./keyrock-wilma-config-script/index.js`
 - Copy the `WILMA_*` env vars from the console output into `.env`
 - Run `docker-compose down`

After it's installed:

 - Run `docker-compose up` to start the services, you should be able to access keyrock from `http://localhost:3000` and the other services in the other ports (check the `docker-compose.yml` file)
 - To stop them, yse `docker-compose down`

If for some reason it does not let you access keyrock (invalid username and password), try resetting it:

 - Remove the `mongo-db` and `mysql` directories.
 - Run the installation steps again.
